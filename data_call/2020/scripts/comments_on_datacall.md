## French's comments about the RDBES data call - YFT stock

We have created our own hierarchy :
```
DE -> SD -> FT -> LE -> SS -> SA -> FM
```


Add some entries in vocabulary :
- RS_Sampler : need an entry to specify that the sampling is done by obsever on shore
- RS_MeasurementType : add an entry for dorsal length
- RS_Presentation : add brined to the code list
